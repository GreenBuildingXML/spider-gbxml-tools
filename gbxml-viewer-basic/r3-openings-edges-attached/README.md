# [gbxml-viewer-basic/r3-openings-edges-attached Read Me]( #gbxml-viewer-basic/r3-openings-edges-attached/README.md )


## Concept

Can we add edges lines and openings meshes to surface meshes? And is there benefit in doing so?

Current response
* Edges easy to add
	* But this makes toggling global visibility more difficult
* Openings fairly easy to attach, but there is still and unsolved rotation bug / gimbal lock issue
	* Note offsets of openings at each end of building
	* Ditto toggling global visibility

The objective
* Make it easier to toggle visibility and perform calculations for edges and openings by space and by storey and by zone

As of this writing success of this objective is not yet visible
