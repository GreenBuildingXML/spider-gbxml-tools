### Draft

Spider gbXML Viewer v0.17.01

A significant new update

1. I am at last not unhappy with the code. It's not great code, but perhaps more importantly it's not bad code.

2. I am not unhappy with the mission and vision. It's not so much about helping humans find errors, it's about fixing the errors for the humans

3. I am not unhappy with the process for increasing awareness of the project. It's not so much about imitating commercial projects and advertising agencies, it's about sharing metrics and standards for open source capabilities and solutions

And given all the un-unhappiness, I am very happy to tackle the future of this project.
