### Draft of issue

Spider gbXML Viewer 'Maevia' v0.17.02

This is a significant update for the following reasons (and more):

1. I am, at last, not unhappy with the code. It's not great code. Perhaps more importantly it's not such bad code either.

2. I am not unhappy with the mission and vision. It's not so much about helping humans find errors. It's now more about fixing the errors for the humans

3. I am not unhappy with the process for increasing awareness of the project. It's not so much about imitating commercial projects and advertising agencies. It's about sharing metrics and standards for open source capabilities and solutions

And given all this un-unhappiness, I am very happy to tackle the future of this project whereever you help me take it.

Things for you to look at include:

* Target reader: a non-technical person, a middle manager or a student

* By clarifying project priorities and converting abstract priorities to measurable values this document develops a common and sharable understanding of the objectives and capabilities of the Spider gbXML Viewer project.
