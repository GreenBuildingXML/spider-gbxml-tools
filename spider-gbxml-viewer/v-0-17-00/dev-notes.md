* code is settling down
* I am happy with the code
* I want t start talking about it, sharing it
* I want people to start looking at the code
* It's not great code, but perhaps more to the point it not bad code
* The levels of indentation are getting to be fewer and fewer. The code is becoming simpler and simpler, the modules smaller and smaller. More small modules rather a few big ones
* The variable and function names are becoming more specific and targeted
* The name space feature makes it easier for you to know where the source code resides
* Everything is being passed through jsHint

Summary

* Handles very large gbXML files in a speedy, no-fail,fashion
* Loads, extracts and saves gbXML files to and from XML files and ZIP files
* Supports files that are local or remote with one button press file reloading
* Displays virtually every aspect of numerical and attribute data in the file
* Supplies a variety of 3D visualization aids including exploding, cut sections
* Begins to provide tools to fix any issues found in the files
* Delivers a user interface that may be themed to fit in with the house style of any organization
* Works just fine on phone, tablet or computer
* Runs locally, on server, in an iframe or even embedded in another app ( such as Open Studio ;-)
* Entirely written in plain vanilla JavaScript with just two dependencies: Three.js and Showdown.js

To Do

* Add Three.js prototype
* Look at remaining functions that do several things
	* POPX
		* hack out button class events
	* GBXU
		* Close all relevent details elements
	* GBX - spin off GB3?
