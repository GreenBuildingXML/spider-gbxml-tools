## Concept

Mission: _Open and examine very large gbXML files in your browser with free, open source JavaScript._

Spider gbXML Viewer opens, parses and displays gbXML files. First released in 1999, [gbXML]( http://gbxml.org) is the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry standard file format for transmitting data between CAD programs such as [Revit]( https://www.autodesk.com/products/revit/overview ), [AutoCAD]( https://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/overview ), [Bentley MicroStation]( https://www.bentley.com/en/products/brands/microstation )  and energy analysis programs such as [Open Studio]( https://www.openstudio.net/ ), [Energy Plus]( https://energyplus.net/ ), [Sefaira]( https://sefaira.com/ ), [TAS Engineering]( https://www.edsl.net/tas-engineering/ ) and others.

gbXML files are generally created as exports from architectural design CAD programs as the minimum 3D representation of building data suitable to carry out energy and illumination studies. The intended purpose of a gbXML file is to act as a method of transferring data between applicatations.  This is similar to CSV, JSON files or other similar uses of XML.

Although the guidelines of the gbXML format are clear and well documented, the process of simplifying data required for a complex building is fraught with issues. In turn the import of gbXML files with problems is also fraught with issues. A sad result is that building engineers around the world spend much time dealing with data file issues - time which would much be much better spent actually analyzing the models and recommending better solutions. The Spider project is an effort to help remedy these issues.

First released in 2017 as a programming exercise, the Spider gbXML Viewer is a web browser viewer of gbXML data. It reads the data from ASCII or ZIP files, parses the data and creates 3D representations viewable in the browser. Right from the get go, designers and engineers saw the potential for the Viewer to help spot errors visually. Within a few months release 12 of the viewer was allowing users to spot many issues as well as providing tools to fix the issues and save the data to new files

The latest version, Spider gbbXML Viewer v0.17.01 - code name 'Maevia' - helps make managing your gbXML files even faster, simpler and provides you with higher quality data transfers.



## Spider gbXML Viewer compliance with _ISO 245010 System and software quality models

Behind the improvements in the Spider gbXML Viewer, there lie a myriad of features and benefits that need to be documented and shared.

A side project for the Spider team is to document Spider gbXML Viewer compliance with _ISO 245010 System and software quality models_. By clarifying project priorities and converting abstract priorities to measurable values, the intention is develop a common understanding of the Spider gbXML Viewer's objectives and goals.

Please have a look at the following document:

## [spider-gbxml-viewer-iso-25010-compliance.md]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider-gbxml-tools/index.html#spider-gbxml-viewer/spider-gbxml-viewer-iso-25010-compliance.md )



## Usage

Note to developers: You may download any of the above files (except the 'dev' version ) to your desktop or wherever ( Chrome context menu > 'Save link as...' ). Then follow the guidelines for loading local files here [Opening and loading files with gbXML Viewer]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider/#pages/file-open.md ) in order to embed the Viewer in a local workflow and avoid CORS issues.

Everybody else: Just work with the online versions and enjoy!
