* To have the minimum of dependencies


### Community-Driven Development

* Ass FOSS as possible


### User Interface

* As little UI exposed in the app as possible
* Make it easy for parent/outside apps to control the script through their UI
* Supply many example of doing this
* Able to support a gamut of uses from complex apps on desktops down to viewing files on old phones

## Styling / CSS

* To support a broad range of CSS system
* Ability to apply styles to HTML elements on-the fly- at run-time


## Testing / QA Goals

* Read any gbXML file from Revit
* Default test case files accepted by OpenStudio geometry Viewer
* Any file accepted by OpenStudio geometry viewer fixes applied by gbXML Viewer

Coming next
* Any gbXML file updated by the gbXML Viewer may be taken all the way through to creating an OpenStdio report without error
* any gbXML file updated by the gbXML Viewer may be read by FZK Viewer without issues
* Suggestions welcome
