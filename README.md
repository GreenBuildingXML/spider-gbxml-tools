## Concept

Scripts to help you view and manage [gbXML]( http://gbxml.org ) files


***

### Latest release: [gbXML Viewer Basic]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider-gbxml-tools/gbxml-viewer-basic/index.html )


#### [gbXML Viewer Basic Read Me]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider-gbxml-tools/#gbxml-viewer-basic/README.md )

* Open, view gbXML files in 3D in your browser with free, open source entry-level Three.js JavaScript
* This script contains the core or basic modules for an entry level viewing experience

***

### [gbXML Viewer Cookbook Gallery]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider-gbxml-tools/#cookbook/cookbook-viewer-one-pager.html )

#### [gbXML Viewer Cookbook Read Me]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider-gbxml-tools/#cookbook/README.md )

* A variety of add-on scripts that enhance Spider gbXML Basic
* Current capabilities include identifying issues with gbXML files, cutting 3D sections through 3D models and more
* Eventually all the features of Spider 'Aragog' Viewer R14 will be added as modules here


***

### Latest release: [Fetch Assemble Save ]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider-gbxml-tools/fetch-assemble-save/index.html )

#### [Fetch Assemble Save Read Me]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider-gbxml-tools/#fetch-assemble-save/README.md )

* Fetch source files from a CDN, assemble these into a single HTML file, save to file
* Build the source code needed to embed the Spider gbXML Viewer in OpenStudio
* 2018-10-23 ~ Currently very out of date. Fixes coming soon
