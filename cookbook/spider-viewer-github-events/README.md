## Concept

view recent GitHub events for a user or organization


Every time an update to a repo, it would be nice if its details are broadcast wherever needed and wanted.

Places where it is nice to see details about updates include:

* The message attached to the commit
* The read me file associated with the particular script
* A message or notice available on the home page

A further desired benefit is to help with generating text for blog posts and announcements regarding the project.

This script is a first pass at establishing such a process.
