## Concept


## Features

* Uses the GitHub API to obtain up to date listings of file names in a directory
* Display list of file names as links to source
* Clicking links displays updates location hash in the address bar
	* The source
	* View the file in this gallery window
	* View the file full screen in its own window
		* Link may be use to embed file in other app or HTML pages


## Wish list

* Links to more sample files
	* Where to find more?
* Credits to sources of files

## Issues

* 2018-05-11 ~ Theo ~ sample files need more and better credits
* 2018-05-11 ~ Theo ~ All sample files need latitude and longitude



## Things you can do using this script

* Click the three bars( 'hamburger menu icon' ) to slide the menu in and out
* Click the Octocat icon to view or edit the source code on GitHub
* Click on title to reload
* Press Control-U/Command-Option-U to view the source code
* Press Control-Shift-J/Command-Option-J to see if the JavaScript console reports any errors
