## Concept

Open and examine very large gbXML files in your browser with free, open source JavaScript

The script is a work in progress for of opening very large gbXML files,

It is currently being tested on a gbXML file ( private and not sharable ) of 698,000,000 bytes and:

* Lines of text: 8,746,903
* Spaces: 5,550
* Surfaces: 70,774
* Zones: 2,618

The file breaks the Chrome browser on Windows 10, the FireFox browser on Windows 10 and OpenStudio on Windows 10

## Full Screen: [Spider gbXML Hacker R1.0]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider-gbxml-tools/sandbox/spider-gbxml-hacker/sandbox/spider-gbxml-hacker.html )

With Chrome browser on Windows 10/Core i7/Nvidia GPU  reads the file and displays limited text data for the file in under 15 seconds. No attempts are made to display data in 3D

* Opens file
* Splits data into an array of trimmed lines
* Searches the array for selected text data such as 'space', 'surface' and 'zone'


## To Do / Wish List

See if we can parse and display in 3D files of this size


## Issues
