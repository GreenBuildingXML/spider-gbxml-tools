## [Sample test run]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider-gbxml-tools/sandbox/spider-gbxml-fixer/r1/spider-gbxml-fixer.html#https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ladybug-tools/spider@master/gbxml-sample-files/bristol-clifton-downs-broken.xml )


## Concept

Many of the issues to be found in parsing gbXML files are clerical matters that can found using simple text search routines. Full 3D viewing of the errors is not needed and may actually slow things down. In future revisions new utilities will add replace capability so that all issues may be fixed and the corrected data saved.

* Run basic checks on gbXML files and identify, report and fix any errors
* The script is still at an early stage. Many more checks may be added.


## To Do / Wish List

* 2019-03-12 ~ Add as many tests currently in Spider gbXML Viewer as possible that do not require 3D
* 2019-03-12 ~ Add fixing the issues where possible
* 2019-03-12 ~ Add check for opening vertices greater then four
* 2019-03-12 ~ Add check for openings larger or outside their parent surface

## Issues

* 2019-03-12 ~ In some workflows an Air surface type with duplicate adjacent spaces is acceptable. You should be able to adjust the settings so an error is not issued.


## Things you can do using this script

* Click 'Open gbXML sample files' to access the Spider gbXML sample files
* Click the three bars( 'hamburger menu icon' ) to slide the menu in and out
* Click the Octocat icon to view or edit the source code on GitHub
* Click on title in the menu to reload the web page
* Press Control-U/Command-Option-U to view the source code
* Press Control-Shift-J/Command-Option-J to see if the JavaScript console reports any errors
