## [Sample test run]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider-gbxml-tools/sandbox/spider-gbxml-tester/r1/spider-gbxml-tester.html#https://rawgit.com/ladybug-tools/spider/master/gbxml-sample-files/bristol-clifton-downs-broken.xml )


## Concept

Many of the issues to be found in parsing gbXML files are clerical matters that can found using simple text search routines - full 3D viewing is not needed and may actually slow things down. In future revisions new utilities will add replace capability so that issues can be fixed and saved.


* Run basic checks on gbXML files and identify & report errors
* The script is still at an early stage. Many more checks can be added.


## To Do / Wish List

* 2019-03-12 ~ Add as many tests currently in Spider gbXML Viewer as possible that do not require 3D
* 2019-03-12 ~ Add fixing the issues where possible
* 2019-03-12 ~ Add check for opening vertices greater then four
* 2019-03-12 ~ Add check for openings larger or outside their parent surface

## Issues

* 2019-03-12 ~ In some workflows an Air surface type with duplicate adjacent spaces acceptable. You should be able to adjust the settings so an error is not issued.


## Things you can do using this script

Using the Script
* Click the three bars( 'hamburger menu icon' ) to slide the menu in and out
* Click the Octocat icon to view or edit the source code on GitHub
* Click on title to reload
* Press Control-U/Command-Option-U to view the source code
* Press Control-Shift-J/Command-Option-J to see if the JavaScript console reports any errors

Enhancing the Script

* Try adding a new menu module
* Translate into another language
